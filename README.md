Network Telemetry & Multimedia Transmission over UDP

This repository contains a complete implementation of a UDP-based communication client used for:
- Echo packet RTT measurements (with and without induced delay)
- Image retrieval from remote cameras
- Audio streaming using DPCM and AQ-DPCM
- Vehicle OBD-II telemetry decoding
- UAV (IthakiCopter) telemetry collection
- MATLAB-based analysis and visualization of collected data

All Java components are fully modularized into separate classes (packet handling, image decoding, sound reconstruction, telemetry parsing).  
Two experiment sessions ("session1" and "session2") are included, each containing:
- Raw measurement files generated by the Java client  
- MATLAB scripts for plotting and further analysis  
- Plots and derived metrics such as mean RTT and variance  

The project is structured so that each session is fully reproducible and self-contained.

MATLAB Analysis

The MATLAB script "plots.m" generates all statistical plots automatically, including:
- RTT evolution graphs  
- Throughput over 8-second windows  
- DPCM waveform visualizations  
- AQ-DPCM parameter evolution  
- Vehicle sensor telemetry plots  
- IthakiCopter multi-sensor plots  

Output figures are saved automatically under a "Plots/" directory.

No MATLAB editing is required other than ensuring that file names match the generated dataset.

Requirements

Java
- JDK 8 or newer  
- DatagramSocket UDP support (standard in Java SE)

MATLAB
- Supports "jsondecode"
- Supports automatic figure saving
- No additional toolboxes required

Notes

- All RTT-related metrics (mean, variance, SRTT, σ, RTO) are computed inside MATLAB.
- AQ-DPCM parameters *(a, bt, c)* used in the analysis are documented in each session’s parameters.txt.
- JSON files must be valid JSON objects for MATLAB to load them correctly.
